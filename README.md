“As a music lover and a future artist, I love to learn from prestigious music makers and would never wanna lose sight of their recent magic.” - Lyte

This is a music downloader web app. It uses Spotify’s API to check if there is a new song of the selected artist(s), if the situation is true, it downloads the current music.

The app works using JavaScript's asynchronous method to download the songs starting from your starred or favourite artist(s) to the end of your artist list. 
And this only works as soon as you have internet connection !
